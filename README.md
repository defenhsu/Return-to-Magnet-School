# Return-to-Magnet-School

Preliminary Step:
- Generate a spreadsheet (and error check) that has all the school-level information for later merging (note that group-specific p-scores still in heterogeneity tests code for now - move to Step 1 eventually)

Step 1: Assignment data file:
manipulate to get p-scores, define siblings

Step 2: Test score files:
Year t+2 test scores, merge onto locator file to get right grade-level
Generate standardized scores where appropriate
(See notes below for ES test score info)

Step 3: 5th grade (why is there no 8th grade??)
STEP NOT NEEDED FOR ELEMENTARY — GETS PREVIOUS TEST SCORE AND DEMOGRAPHIC T-1 DATA
FOR MS/HS CODE, NEED TO ADD T-1 INFORMATION INCLUDING SPED (DETERMINED IN 3RD GRADE), T-1 TEST SCORES, ETC TO GET VALUE ADDED MEASURES.  ALSO ALLOWS FOR BALANCE TESTING

Step 4: Absences 
Define absences`y’ files 2015-2018
** total_absences total_excused/unexcused tot_schols_attend grade_level current_school year encrypted

STEP 5A: get kindergartners, define on-time progress

Step 5: Merge all the data together, using the huge locator file as the base
Finished ES, testing
